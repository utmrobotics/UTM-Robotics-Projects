# UTM Robotics Club Projects

Welcome to the **UTM Robotics Club** project repository!  
Here you’ll find our current and past projects, along with a **getting started guide** for anyone interested in contributing.

## Projects in Progress
- **Robot Arm** – A robotic manipulator we're desiging and constructing from scratch! Our goal is to integrate computer vision for object detection in the near future.
- **Roomba** – Programming the Kobuki robots (a Roomba-like robot) to perform autonomous navigation and mapping tasks.
- **IR Line Follower** – A fully 3D-printable infrared line-following robot that we’re designing and building from scratch! Our goal is to create a simple, reproducible design that allows members to print, assemble, and race their own versions.

## Past Projects
- **Robot Dog** – A 3D-printed quadruped robot built using open-source designs by [Aaed Musa](https://www.instructables.com/3D-Printed-Robot-Dog/).

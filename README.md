# UTM Robotics Club Projects

Welcome to the **UTM Robotics Club** project repository!  
Here you’ll find our current and past projects, along with a **Getting Started Guide** for anyone interested in contributing.

## Projects in Progress
- **Robot Arm** – A robotic manipulator we're desiging and constructing from scratch! Our goal is to integrate computer vision for object detection in the near future.
- **Roomba** – Programming the Kobuki robots (a Roomba-like robot) to perform autonomous navigation and mapping tasks.
- **IR Line Follower** – A fully 3D-printable infrared line-following robot that we’re designing and building from scratch! Our goal is to create a simple, reproducible design that allows members to print, assemble, and race their own versions.

## Past Projects
- **Robot Dog** – A 3D-printed quadruped robot built using open-source designs by [Aaed Musa](https://www.instructables.com/3D-Printed-Robot-Dog/).

## Getting Started Guide
We always have room for anyone in our projects, to be honest, we're running short of people! As long as you're willing to learn new skills you'll be able to contribute a whole lot to our projects and learn many skills while you're at it! For each project in progress I've listed our estimated progress so far, what skills they require, and some resources and instructions for getting started, along with a detailed description of the projects goals and idea.

## Robot Arm
The robot arm will be constructed out of 3D-printed parts we're currently designing in a CAD software, we're using Fusion 360.
Current Goals:
## Build and design the robot arm
The robot arm will look something like this (but we'll put our own spin on it)
